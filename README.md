# Description
1-day Value at risk (VaR) is the maximum potential loss to portifolio if the value of an held asset suddenly changes overnight while markets are closed. In my project, I focused on VaR in the currency markets, from the perspective of Authorised Dealer Banks, keeping the alpha at 1% or 2.33 standard deviation units.
